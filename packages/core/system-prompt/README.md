## Summary

`dsh-system-prompt` lets agents receive one ordered system prompt and the available tool schemas for each model step. Use it to add prompt sections, dynamic runtime facts, reusable variables, or tool schemas, or to control the runtime-host label, deployment persona, runtime context, and model-facing tool order. Agent-scoped contributions override same-named global defaults without affecting other agents. Invalid complete-prompt combinations and unresolved variables fail assembly instead of sending a malformed prompt.

## Use this package

Mount `dsh-system-prompt` wherever agents run: it provides `ctx.systemPrompt`, the registry every prompt contribution lands in. Contributions are scoped — registering through `agent.ctx` affects that agent alone and shadows a same-named global.

<a id="configure-the-prompt"></a>
### Configure the prompt

The config owns the fixed opener, runtime context, deployment persona prefix and suffix, and tool order; everything else comes from registered contributions.

`requiredSections` checks registrations after scoped shadowing and preparation, before section text, variables, tools, or suppression callbacks run. Suppression and complete prompts still pass this registration check. With `preserveSections: true`, a selected required section with nonblank template text must also render nonblank; intentional empty templates remain valid. The optional `version` is registration metadata and does not change rendered prompt text.

Shipped profiles require version `'1'` for `tools:calling` and both deployment persona sections. Profiles that enable `harness:identity` require its version too. Scoped shadows of these sections must declare the same version; this check does not authenticate section text.

Tool, mode, skill, MCP, and runtime-context contributions remain capability-dependent, so profiles do not require them as universal prompt sections.

```yaml
- name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-system-prompt'
  config:
    includeHarnessIdentity: true
    includeRuntimeContext: true
    personaPrefix: 'You are the deployment assistant.'
    toolOrder: ['<unlisted-tools>']
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `requiredSections` | `{}` | After preparation and scoped shadowing, require each named effective registration to carry the exact configured `version` before section, variable, or tool providers run. Missing, unversioned, or different versions reject assembly. Suppression and complete-section selection do not remove this registration check. |
| `preserveSections` | `false` | Preserve each effective registered section selected for this assembly across the waterfall: its name, contribution text, interpolation flag, and relative order. Suppression and complete-section selection happen first. Standalone use defaults off; shipped profiles enable it. Selected required sections with nonblank templates must render nonblank using final waterfall variables. Added sections, tools, contexts, and routed variables remain available. |
| `includeHarnessIdentity` | `true` | Include the factual `Runtime host: Shield Break Harness.` label at order −1000. It assigns no model identity or persona. Set false to omit the label. |
| `includeRuntimeContext` | `true` | Include ordered dynamic runtime context in assembly |
| `personaPrefix` | `''` | Global persona prefix template at order `0`, before first-party guidance |
| `personaSuffix` | `''` | Global `deployment:persona-suffix` template at order `10200`, after first-party guidance |
| `toolOrder` | — | Explicit model-facing tool order with one `'<unlisted-tools>'` rest entry |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-system-prompt) is the exhaustive source for every accepted field. A `toolOrder` list without exactly one rest entry or with duplicates fails at load; a listed name with no registered tool rejects every `assemble()`.

### Contribute a prompt section

Sections carry static or context-resolved text with an `order`; they are concatenated in ascending order and equal orders use code-unit name order. Repository-owned contributors resolve centrally allocated positions through `ctx.systemPrompt.getSectionOrder(name)`; runtime-context contributors use `getContextOrder(name)`. External contributions may use any finite order. A `complete: true` section becomes the exact complete prompt after assembly; more than one effective complete section makes assembly fail.

```text
ctx.systemPrompt.section({
  name: 'tool:bash',
  order: 100,
  text: 'Prefer bash for file and process operations.',
})
```

Set `version` when a deployment may require this registration at an exact version.

Set `interpolate: false` on a section to preserve its text literally, including `{{…}}` groups in generated tool documentation. Other sections interpolate variables by default.

### Contribute a prompt variable

Variables are referenced from section text as `{{name}}` and resolved at each assembly; scoped variables shadow a same-named global for that agent. The loop supplies `model` and `cwd`; any plugin can register the facts it owns.

```text
ctx.systemPrompt.variable('cwd', ({ agent }) => agent?.session.header.cwd)
```

### Contribute tool schemas

Tool-schema providers are evaluated per assembly and contribute the model-visible `ToolSchema` set; `ToolRuntime` registers itself automatically, so most tools need no manual wiring here. A provider returns the post-restriction visible set plus the pre-restriction name universe used by `toolOrder`.

### Suppress runtime context

`suppressRuntimeContext()` removes every dynamic runtime-context contribution for the calling scope without disabling the services that own the underlying facts; multiple suppressors compose and the effect restores context when none remains.

`suppressSections()` re-evaluates live allowlists at each assembly. An undefined allowlist disables that suppressor; an empty list withholds every gated section. Callback providers receive scoped section names, the assembly context, and all effective section names. With `globalOnly: true`, preset-scoped contributions remain visible.

The scope-filtered `system-prompt/prepare` serial event runs before provider values, suppression decisions, or section selection are read. Use it to refresh settings that affect the next assembly; a rejected listener prevents provider evaluation. The separate `system-prompt/assemble` waterfall runs after those inputs are resolved.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

This section explains how the package realizes the behavior above; the observable contract is covered in [Use this package](#use-this-package).

### Design concept

The package is a registry plus a cooperative assembly pipeline. One `assemble()` call first runs the scope-filtered `system-prompt/prepare` serial event, then merges the global layer with the requested scope's layer, detaches tool parameters, canonicalizes section order by number and then name, runs the scope-filtered `system-prompt/assemble` waterfall, restores an effective complete section as the sole prompt section, and applies any active runtime-context suppressor. Sections and dynamic contexts are separate inputs: sections become prompt text, while contexts become sourced user-role snapshots in model history under the loop. Tool schemas are part of the assembly by design — "what the model is told it can do" is one coherent thing, even though adapters transmit schemas as a separate wire field.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | Plugin entry: `SystemPrompt` service, config, assembly pipeline, `renderPrompt` |
| [`src/invariant.ts`](src/invariant.ts) | Invariant companion |

### Assembly and rendering

Assembly resolves and renders in two stages: `assemble()` returns sections with resolved-but-uninterpolated text, the ordered tool schemas, and every registered variable resolved against the context. On the assembly returned by `assemble()`, `renderPrompt()` interpolates `{{variable}}` references unless a section sets `interpolate: false`, drops empty optional sections, and joins with blank lines. When preservation is enabled, selected required sections with nonblank templates must remain nonblank after this final interpolation; malformed, unknown, or valueless references in those sections report only the section name. Other interpolation failures retain their detailed diagnostics. `toolOrder` canonicalizes the collected tools before the waterfall (registration order is a plugin-load artifact); a waterfall listener that mutates the list owns the determinism of what it emits.

### Scoping

Scoped sections, variables, and tool providers shadow globals for one agent, and the assembly waterfall dispatches scope-filtered. Registry-change notifications (`system-prompt/change`) are deliberately unfiltered because a global change affects every scope.

## Model Experience

### System prompt

#### What the model sees

First-party sections render the factual runtime-host label, deployment persona prefix (including the model-name introduction), reusable instructions (including the generated tools SDK and structured-output guidance), then the environment-bearing suffix: harness source (`10000`), Web surface (`10100`), and deployment persona suffix (`10200`). External section orders and assembly listeners remain authoritative. `includeHarnessIdentity: false` omits only that runtime label. The deployment persona defines model identity and behavior. Empty sections disappear; scoped sections and variables can shadow globals for one agent. The `system-prompt/assemble` waterfall determines the delivered prompt and tool schemas unless one effective section declares itself complete — that exact section then becomes the whole system prompt while the waterfall's contexts, tools, and variables remain. The rendered prompt reaches the model as a system-role message of derived history — surface node 0, or the latest system node after an in-history update — neither the loop request nor `request/header` carries a separate `system` field. If the complete rendering is empty, the loop clears every active system node through logged empty replacements, so no older prompt remains in model history. Ordered dynamic contexts are separate from sections and become sourced user-role snapshots only when present; `includeRuntimeContext: false` or a scoped suppressor removes them all.

##### Runtime host

```markdown
Runtime host: Shield Break Harness.
```

#### Token effect

The runtime label is a fixed per-request cost when enabled. Persona prefixes, suffixes, and plugin text are repeated per request and scale with their rendered content.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while runtime label, persona, variables, section text, and order render identically: an unchanged rendering leaves the system nodes untouched unless an incapable route or a new request series must consolidate retained in-history prompts. Without `systemPromptUpdate`, non-empty prompt text is consolidated at the first system node through logged per-node replacements, so a head rewrite loses prefix reuse from its first changed token; when the prepared call declares `systemPromptUpdate: 'in-history'`, the agent loop appends a non-empty changed prompt after the cached history inside a continuing request series, so the prefix through that history stays reusable ([decision rule](../agent-loop/README.md#understand-the-implementation)). With the same model, persona prefix, tools, and preceding instructions, different source paths, local Web URLs, or persona suffix values leave the reusable first-party prefix unchanged. Persona prefix changes can alter the early prefix. Any change may invalidate reuse from the first changed token; provider cache sharing and measured hit rates are not guaranteed.

### Tool schemas

#### What the model sees

For shipped tools, the model receives the per-agent-visible subset of the [generated tool schemas](../../../docs/tool-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-tools), ordered by configuration or lexicographically after restrictions and assembly interception. Extensions can contribute additional definitions through the same registry. Sections and schema providers are separate assembly inputs. A restriction does not remove a section registration: tool-guidance plugins use `text({ scope })` and `ctx.tools.get(name, scope)` to return empty text or select applicable fragments. Arbitrary static sections are not automatically rewritten.

#### Token effect

Schema tokens repeat on every request. Restricting a tool removes its entire schema cost for that agent but not a separate prompt section; reordering changes cache shape but not semantic content.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the visible schema set, rendering, and order are unchanged. Registration, restriction, or reordering may invalidate reuse from the first changed schema token.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define when prompt assembly needs special care. They are current package constraints, not a task backlog.

- **Deployment-authored prompt text is config/composition only** — this plugin owns the global persona prefix and suffix defaults, creator plugins may register agent-scoped shadows, and other sections come from the plugin that owns the fact; there is no end-user prompt-editing API.
- **Required section versions identify registrations** — preserved selected sections are checked for nonblank rendered text, but their content is not pinned to an approved value.
- **No inline escape syntax in interpolated text** — use `interpolate: false` when a whole section must preserve literal braces.
- **`toolOrder` misconfiguration surfaces at prompt assembly (the first turn), not at boot** — only shape violations throw at config load.
